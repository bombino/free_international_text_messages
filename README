To use:

1.  Obtain an unlocked GSM phone (ideally quad-band), to ensure the best
    global romaing capabilities.

2.  Get a SIM card from http://www.gosim.com/

3.  Sign up for Google Voice and get a Google Voice number.
    http://www.google.com/voice/

4.  Set up a cronjob that will run the enclosed Ruby script every
    5-10 minutes.  It's what does the forwarding.

5.  Edit the config block at the top of the Ruby script to include 
    your Google username and password, GOSIM username and password,
    and GOSIM phone number.

6.  You may need to install Ruby on your server (see your OS vendor
    for more information).

7.  You will probably also need to install the gvoice-ruby gem.  You 
    can do this by typing:
    
    sudo gem install gvoice-ruby
